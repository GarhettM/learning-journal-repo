Git is a DVCS that stored data in a file system made up of snapshots.
  - Every saved change is called a "commit"
  - Git relies on local information mostly. Its main role is a cloud storage or "repository"
  - Git will detect corruptions
  - Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed (data is secured and stored in local), modified (file is changed but not committed), and staged.
  
  Some git code
  - Importing `cd name` then use `git init` this creates a subdirectory named .git
  - To track these `git add *.c` then `git add LICENSE` then `git commit -m "any message here"`
  - Cloning a repository `git clone http://locvatiofrepository.com
  - to clone into a repository `git clone http://locationofrepository.com mydirectory
  
  The local Git repository has three components:
    - Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
    - Index: The area used for staging
    - Head: Points to the most recent commit

   To determine the state og a file use `git status`this will show the branch wim on and shows any changed files.
    - to switcch to or "track" a new repository use `git add filename`
    - to track all files in a repository, use `git add *`
    
   `git commit -m "message of changes here"
   In order to push chnges to remote repository use `git push origin master`
    
   If im working on changes but don't want to commit them yet I can use `git stash` to hide changes and then use `git stash apply` to get them back
    
  `git remote` and `git remote -v` will show all the remote repositories
    - start with `cd filename`
    - then use `git remote -v`
    - to add a remote repo `git remote add shortname url`
 
 
Fetching: THis pulls data that I don't have from a remote project.
  - `git fetch [remote name]` will retrieve from a remote file. Need to have the references to all the branches for that remote location
  
  **Note:** git fetch solely pulls new data to a local repository; it does not merge changes with or modify your local work. We will discuss merging in a later section. Later, we will also discuss git pull , which allows for fetching and automatic merging.
  
**Pushing:** Use `git push [remote name][branch name]
  - for example `git push origin master`
  
To Rename a remote location `git remote rename`
    - example `git remote js jane` in this example we renamed "js" to "jane"
    
To Remove a remote location `git remote rm jane`

**Undoing Actions** 
Commit mistakes: `git commit --amend`
  - example: `git commit -m "first commit"
  - `git add example_file`
  - `git commit --amend`
  
**Unstaging a file**
  - `git reset HEAD index.html`
  
**Umoddifying a file**
  - `git checkout `` index.html
