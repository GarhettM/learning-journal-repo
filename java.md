`console.log` is IMPORTANT tool to see whats happening in your website! Use this to see where your function is broken or falling to.
Any number that is entered into the "prompts" will always be returned as a string.
== only looking at the character 
=== looking at character and data type (this is what is used real world mostly)
!= NOT equal character
!== NOT equal character and data type
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. An expression that assigns a value `var color = 'beige';` and expressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value. `var area = 3 * 2;`
You can do this with strings as well
pg 74-79 reference
ex `greeting = 'Hi' + 'Molly'`
++ and -- add and subtract '1' from current number
% divides to values and returns the remainder!! ex `10 % 3` returns '1'
