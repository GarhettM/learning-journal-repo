`console.log` is IMPORTANT tool to see whats happening in your website! Use this to see where your function is broken or falling to.

Any number that is entered into the "prompts" will always be returned as a string.

== only looking at the character 

=== looking at character and data type (this is what is used real world mostly)

!= NOT equal character

!== NOT equal character and data type

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. An expression that assigns a value `var color = 'beige';` and expressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value. `var area = 3 * 2;`

`var 'name'` = `function('name')`    {

}`

You can do this with strings as well

pg 74-79 reference

ex `greeting = 'Hi' + 'Molly'`

++ and -- add and subtract '1' from current number

% divides two values and returns the remainder!! ex `10 % 3` returns '1'

All things typed into a prompt is a string.

FOR LOOPS!

`for` is the key word for a "for loop"

`for (var i =0 ; i <= 12; i = i + 1)

["this", "is", "an", "array"]

While LOOPS!

while( count ==='' || isNaN(count)){
    count = prompt('Please enter a number. How many do you want')
}

`||` <=== THIS MEANS "OR"
`===` this is `true` or `false`
