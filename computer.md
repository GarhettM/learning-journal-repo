Computer in a nutshell
    Input
        User controlled

    Storage
        inputs are stored in memory
    Processing
        uses the stored memory to manipulate
    Output
        many different ways to output.
        all output comes from the processing unit

Early comps were made out of wood??

    1's and 0's

1 wire with a current on or off, true or false, 1 or 0
    these are the bits.

Every input or output is information that is represented by 1's and 0's 

circuits are combined inputs and outputs in motion

"Not" circuit flips the input signal

"And" circuits take 2 signals and if the both are not true then the circuit will be false 

Inputs get converted into binary

outputs act in the opposite
