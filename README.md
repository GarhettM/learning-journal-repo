## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/GarhettM/learning-journal-repo/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GarhettM/learning-journal-repo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Growth Mindset
What comes up for me when discussing "Growth Mindset" is the practice of mindfullness. For me, language is the epicenter for how we run our lives from day to day. For example, the word "hard" is always used to describe something as a "hard" concept. While the term "hard" can be made "real" in a sense i.e. lifting 200lbs over your head is hard if you can barely get 100lbs up there, using this language can stop me from pursuing things before I even try. Therefore, having a Growth Mindset is all about how we percieve the challenges or obstacles in front of us. In short, the idea is to face a difficult challenge and telling myself "This is hard and there are actions to take" instead of "This is hard and so I can't do it."
