## Growth Mindset
What comes up for me when discussing _"Growth Mindset"_ is the practice of mindfullness. For me, language is the epicenter for how we run our lives from day to day. For example, the word "hard" is always used to describe something as a "hard" concept. While the term "hard" can be made "real" in a sense i.e. lifting 200lbs over your head is hard if you can barely get 100lbs up there, using this language can stop me from pursuing things before I even try. Therefore, having a Growth Mindset is all about how we percieve the challenges or obstacles in front of us. **In short, the idea is to face a difficult challenge by telling myself "This is hard and there are actions to take" instead of "This is hard and so I can't do it."**

Feel free to check out [Landmark Worldwide](http://www.landmarkworldwide.com) for mindfullness courses that truly changed my life for the better and got me on a path to success.

### 3 Reminders for myself
- I have a clear goal for why I'm here.
- This is what I've always wanted to do with my life.
- I am valuable and worthy of a life I have always wanted to live.
