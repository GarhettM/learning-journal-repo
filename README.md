Hello All!

I grew up here in Seattle but have lived in Chicago for a few years, as well as, Texas for a some time. I played baseball for Triton College in the west side of Chicago right after high school. After moving home I enlisted in the US Army to pay off my student loans. I spent 4.5 years in Ft Hood Texas while serving in Mosul, Iraq for a year and Bagram, Afghanistan for 9 months.
